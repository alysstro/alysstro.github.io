		<h2>Reflection of the program</h2>
		<p>I think that the ATM program teaches us many things that we can use in future jobs and things that we can benefit from in highschool and college. I also think that it is very important to be able to learn these things because it gives us an advantage in life because we are moving so quickly with advancing technology. I feel like now that I have these skills I can go into many different tech heavy jobs and will get ahead of people that donâ€™t know much about technology easily. I think that it is really cool that we have this option in middle school because it gives the advantage in high school because we know more about apple use than most people who have been in the ATM program in high school.</p>
