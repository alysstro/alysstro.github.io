		<h2>My Future</h2>
			
		<h2>Highschool</h2>
		<p>My mom went to Lakewood and also taught at Lakewood for a while as a student teacher. My brother is going to Lakewood as a freshman right now. So next year I am going to Lakewood because I have no choice but to go to Lakewood High School.</p>
		<h2>College</h2>

		<p>I want to go to Cal State Long Beach (CSULB) because it is really close by and my mom went there so I think it would be more comfortable. I also want to go there because its a universety and I would much rather go there than a city college. I also want to go to CSULB because its close to home and I don't want to be far from home.</p>
		<h2>Career Interests</h2>
		<img src="https://lh3.google.com/u/0/d/0B-kQ17u9NGVjdExiMnlpekFpUDg=w1027-h855-iv1" alt="space" width=200>
		<p>I like the thought of working with something to do with space. I think space is really cool cause its so big and even though we've seen so much of it, we haven't even seen basically anything. I also like the thought of working for the government because I think that job would never get boring either.</p>
		<h2>Goals</h2>
		<p>My goals would prbably be to get good grades, so I can get into CSULB. I also want to get a good job that pays well and isn't boring.</p>
